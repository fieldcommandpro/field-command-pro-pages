  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="small">Effective date: <strong>August 13, 2025</strong></p>

  <div class="box">
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Field Command Pro</strong> (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use <strong>Field Command Pro</strong> (the “App”). We use Facebook Login (Meta) to authenticate users. This page is publicly accessible and intended to satisfy Meta’s platform requirements.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>From Facebook Login</strong>: your public profile (e.g., name, profile photo), email address, and any additional permissions we explicitly request and you grant. We do not access friends lists or other data without approval.</li>
    <li><strong>App Usage</strong>: device information, logs, and diagnostic data necessary to operate and secure the App.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To authenticate you and provide core App functionality.</li>
    <li>To maintain security, prevent fraud/abuse, and fix bugs.</li>
    <li>To comply with legal obligations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share data with service providers that help us operate the App (e.g., hosting, analytics) under contracts that limit their use. We may disclose information if required by law or to protect rights and safety.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain personal information only for as long as needed for the purposes above or as required by law. When no longer needed, we delete or anonymize it.</p>

  <h2>5. Your Choices & Rights</h2>
  <p>You may request access, correction, or deletion of your data. See the <a href="data-deletion.html">Data Deletion Instructions</a> for how to request deletion. Depending on your location, you may have additional rights (e.g., GDPR/CCPA). Contact us to exercise these rights.</p>

  <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age in your country), and we do not knowingly collect data from them.</p>

  <h2>7. International Transfers</h2>
  <p>Your information may be processed in countries other than your own. Where required, we implement appropriate safeguards.</p>

  <h2>8. Security</h2>
  <p>We use administrative, technical, and physical measures designed to protect information. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

  <h2>9. Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update this Policy. We will update the “Effective date” above and, where appropriate, notify you.</p>

  <h2>10. Contact</h2>
